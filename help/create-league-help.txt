How To Create A League For Footy Predictor V1.24
------------------------------------------------
I have tried to make the process as simple as possible so that
anyone can create, and then load in their favourite league(s),
here's how. 

Maximum of 28 Teams:
---------------------
The number one requirement is that the league has a maximum
of 28 teams in it, which just about covers every league
I've ever seen, so hopefully that's not a problem for anyone.
It's okay to have less teams than 28 teams in your league of course.

Your files must go inside the "leagues" folder:
----------------------------------------------
If you look inside the "leagues" folder of Footy Predictor
you can see an example that I have made for the English 
Championship league. Your league files must reside here.

Must be Three text files:
-------------------------
Three text files are required to make a league, these are very simple,
but must be created in plain text with no control codes, in other words 
create\edit these files in notepad.exe or similar, I use Notepad++
which is a brilliant free editor.

File one:
----------
Must be named with the name of the league and use caps for the first letters;
Example: "English Championship.fpcl"

Note:
As from V1.01 I have changed the main custom league file extension from .txt to .fpcl
(footy predictor custom league) to save confusion about which file to load from the league menu. It is still just a text file but with a made up extension name. Now when you click load league only one file will show up for each league avaiable.

Inside, the file must contain the team names of every team in your league.
You don't have to, but I like to list them alphabetically, to make finding
a team quick and easy in the drop-down lists in the program.
Please capitalize the team names.
Example:

Barnsley
Birmingham
Blackburn
Bournemouth
Brentford
Bristol City
Cardiff
Coventry
Derby
Huddersfield
Luton
Middlesbrough
Millwall
Norwich
Nottm Forest
Preston NE
QPR
Reading
Rotherham
Sheff Wed
Stoke
Swansea
Watford
Wycombe

No blank lines please or there will be problems,
pay special attention to start and end of file,
no blankies or it will mess things up.

If you have problems or don't understand what I'm on about then
You could copy and edit my English Championship.txt file and save it under your league name instead.

File Two
--------
Must be named the same as file one but with "-ratings" added on to it, and the file extension should be 'txt'.

Example:
"English Championship-ratings.txt"

Inside this text file is simply a base rating for each team, in the same order as you listed your teams in file one.

How I rate each team 
---------------------
I start with what I believe to be the worst team in the league 
and give them a rating of zero. I then look for the next
best team and give them a 1, or maybe a 2 if they are significantly better
than the worst team, or a zero again if they are equally as bad as the worst.

I usually end up with a highest rating of 6 or maybe 7
(There is a maximum rating of 9)

Throughout the course of the season I manually update the ratings to
reflect current form.

This is all down to your judgement, so if FP is predicting crazy results
and the predictions are wrong most of the time then you best take a look
at your ratings.

Note: I am referring mostly to home, draw, away predictions, rather than
correct scores, as correct score predictions are impossibly difficult to get right more than 10-15% of the time, that's why the bookies will give you what look like good odds on correct scores, 8\1 being a common price
for example.

Tip: Try not to be biased toward the teams that you love or hate when 
     editing ratings. LOL.

Example file2:

3
3
4
7
5
6
3
2
0

5
4
7
2
3
3
6
2
1
5
5
6
1

No blank lines anywhere and plain text only.
 

File Three:
------------
This is really easy, it is just a copy of the ratings 
that you have just made for file 2.
Make a copy of file 2 and rename it.

Example:

"English Championship-ratings-orig.txt"

This is so that the user can restore the original ratings that you 
set up at the start, should they mess it all up.

That's it.

If all goes well, you should be able to load your league into Footy Predictor via the "Load A League" item in the "Leagues" menu.

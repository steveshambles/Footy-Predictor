Match Head To Head Help For Footy Predictor V1.24
-------------------------------------------------
When you click on the "Head 2 Head" button from the main program
a 29 season Premier League history of the fixture 
you chose in the main program will be shown in a text box.

Obviously not all teams currently in the Premier League have
always been in the PL, so some years may be missing whilst they
played in the lower divisions.

Here is an example of a typical head to head match history.

In the main program I picked Chelsea for the home team,
Tottenham for the away team, and then clicked on the
"Head 2 Head" button and this information popped up in a box.

Note: I decided NOT to link the head 2 head data to 
FP's prediction algo because I am sceptical on how
much use old matches are in a lot of cases, however, for
most footy fans this info will be very interesting, it
fascinates me for sure, and in some cases
looking at the h2h history can pull out some good priced
results if considered alongside current form.

But I like to think that current form alone is a
much better overall predictor of the likely outcome
of a match.

Good luck.
